                            <h3>System Overview</h3>
                                <p>
                                    BMS will not have any control on the operation of Water Booster pump. It consist of 2 pumps and are located at roof level of each block. These pumps are provided with VFD and having a stand-alone control for modulating the VFDs as per the water pressure. BMS shall be monitoring the following.
                                </p>
                                    <ul class="equip-list">
                                        <li>Supply water pressure</li>
                                        <li>Pump Hand/Off/ Auto status</li>
                                        <li>Pump Run status</li>
                                        <li>Pump Trip status</li>
                                    </ul>
                            <h4>Alarm Reset</h4>
                                <p>
                                    When the pump start command is issued by the BMS, then the BMS monitors the TRIP status & the RUN status of the pump. In case that if any of the status goes to OFF/ALARM condition, then BMS will generate a PUMP FAIL ALARM (point will be displayed on the central graphic). This alarm shall be latched until the operator resets it. The pump start/stop command shall be OFF from the BMS until this alarm is reset.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Plant Reset</h4>
                                <p>
                                    If the unit is in "Fail" condition, then the operator can reset this alarm by using the plantÂ­ reset button available on graphic screen or by putting the respective equipment H/O/A switch status in OFF or HAND mode and bringing it back to AUTO mode from local control panel (This provision is provided to facilitate the operator to reset respective equipment alarms in case graphic communication fails with controllers). To do the Plant -reset, the manual mode check box provided in the graphics should be checked and then the RESET option should be selected. Once the RESET is activated it will come back to NORMAL state automatically after predefined delay time and mode. checkbox will be unchecked automatically
                                </p>
                            <h4>Alarms</h4>

                                    The following alarms would be generated on BMS.
                                </p>

                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pump Trip Signal:</span>This is generated when the Pump Trip Signal is on as sensed by panel volt free contact.
                                    The above alarms are active on the BMS irrespective of whether the H/0/A switch is in "Hand" or "Auto" position.<br>
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pump Fail:</span>In case the pump fails to start or if the run status from the MCC panel is not giving the signal according to the command (given from the BMS) due to any reason or Pump trip signal is received then an alarm will be generated.
                                </p>
