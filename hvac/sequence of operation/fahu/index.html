                                    <ol class="operation">
                                        <li>The FAHU Supply air fan shall be operated by the BMS when:</li>
                                            <ul class="operated-list">

                                        <li> Once the above conditions are satisfied, FAHU is enabled to start in Auto mode (based on time schedule) or using a plant enable button on the graphics in manual mode by operator. Once enabled BMS will automatically command fresh air damper to "OPEN".</li>
                                        <li> BMS will monitor the damper status. If the damper open status from damper end switch is not received within preset time delay of 120 sec after open command is issued then an alarm will be generated and latched on the BMS and FAHU enable command shall be disabled:.</li>
                                        <li> After confirmation of dampers open status, BMS will command supply fan to start. Once the start command is issued then BMS shall monitor the differential pressure airflow switch of the fan. If the airflow switch signal is proved "ON" then BMS will enable temperature control loop to modulate the cooling coil valve, dehumidification control loop, Supply fan speed control loop, Exhaust Air Fan control and Heat Recovery Wheel Control.</li>
                                        <li> If the fan run status from the Differential pressure airflow switch is not proved 'On' within preset time delay of 120 seconds after the start command is being issued then an alarm . will be generated and latched on the BMS and the FAHU enable command shall be disabled. BMS will automatically command fresh air damper to close.</li>
                                        <li> The controls shall be programmed to operate the AHU for continuous 24 Hours, 7 days a week time schedule in normal mode of operation. Only in case of Fire Alarm signal for respective zone, BMS will operate the FAHU as per the detailed sequence mentioned below in Fire & Smoke mode operation Thyristor Heater.</li>
                                        <li> The operator can stop the FAHU from the BMS anytime; however, the default state of the FAHU when the DOC is reset or powered up is START.</li>

                                <p>
                                    Heat recovery wheel is used to pre-cool the fresh air at the point of entry to the FAHU before reaching it to cooling coil.

                            <h4>Temperature Control Loop</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The supply temperature sensor installed in the supply air duct after Thyristor heater will relay the measured signal (temperature) to the DOC controller, the DOC controller compares this signal with the set-point (adjustable by the operator from BMS central) and generates an analogue output to the 2-way modulating cooling valve. Based on the difference between the two values, a Proportional - Integral - Derivative program will determine the percentage of the cooling coil valves opening to achieve the desired condition. Initially primary cooling coil valve (small cooling coil) will be modulated / open fully to achieve desired condition. In the event, if the primary cooling coil is unable to achieve desired condition after opening fully (100%) then Secondary cooling coil valve (Bigger Cooling Coil) will modulate to achieve desired condition, if applicable. The 2-way valve is mounted on the CHW return pipe. The default set-point value for the supply air temperature is 19.5 Â°C (Adjustable)<br>
                                    In the event if supply air temperature is below its set point and both cooling coil valves are fully closed then BMS will modulate electric heater current to achieve the desired supply air temperature condition.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Dehumidification Control</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The supply air Humidity sensor installed in the supply air duct after Thyristor heater will relay the measured signal (humidity) to the DOC controller. If the supply air humidity is above its high humidity set point 70% RH (user adjustable) then BMS will modulate the cooling coil valve based on either Humidity control loop output or Temperature control loop output whichever is higher.<br>
                                    BMS will continuously monitor the supply air temperature and if it goes below its set point then BMS modulate electric heater current to achieve the desired supply air temperature condition.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Fan Speed Control Loop</h4>
                                <p>
                                    In Normal mode the supply fan will be running at its maximum speed. But ari option will be provided in the graphics for the operator to change the speed if a requirement comes.<br>
                                    The extract air fan will always be running at constant speed.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Fire & Smoke Mode Operation</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Fire alarm system will provide common Fire Alarm signal for respective zone. On receipt of this signal BMS will shutdown the FAHU Extract air Fan and HRW. The supply air fan will continue to run to provide fresh treated air to one floor above and below the fired floor.<br>
                                    FAS system will close all the Fresh air dampers (SMFD) of all the recirculating AHU's except one floor above and below the fired floor, as applicable. This is used to minimize the impact of fire by pressurizing the floors (one above and one below) by fresh air.<br>
                                    Once the fire alarm signal is normalized BMS will automatically issue the command to switch ON the unit as per normal mode of operation.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Alarm Reset</h4>
                                <p>
                                    When the supply air fan start command is issued by the BMS, then the BMS monitors the TRIP status of the fan & the RUN status of the fan from differential pressure switch. In case that if any of the status goes to OFF/ALARM condition, then BMS will generate a FAN FAIL ALARM (point will be displayed on the central graphic). This alarm shall be latched until the operator resets it. The unit start/stop command shall be OFF from the BMS until this alarm is reset.<br>
                                    When the extract air fan start command is issued by the BMS, then the BMS monitors the TRIP status of the fan & the RUN status of the fan from differential pressure switch. In case that if any of the status goes to OFF/ALARM condition, then BMS will generate a FAN FAIL ALARM (point will be displayed on the central graphic).

                                <p>
                                    If the unit is in "Fail" condition, then the operator can reset this alarm by using the plantÂ­ reset button available on graphic screen or by putting the respective equipment H/O/A switch status in OFF or HAND mode and bringing it back to AUTO mode from local control panel (This provision is provided to facilitate the operator to reset respective equipment alarms in case graphic central communication fails with controllers). To do the Plant-reset, the manual mode check box provided in the graphics should be checked and then the RESET option should be selected. Once the RESET is activated it will come back to NORMAL state automatically after predefined delay time and mode checkbox will be unchecked automatically.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Alarms</h4>
