                            <h3>System Overview</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Typical VFD air handling units located as per the designated floors in the building will supply filtered, cooled air which is distributed through (high and medium pressure) duct systems and supplied to the space through VAV terminal units.<br>
                                    Air from the space returns to the respective AHU's via a duct drawing air from the ceiling voids and connected to AHU mixing <br>
                                    The unit is comprised of:
                                </p>
                                    <ul class="equip-list">
                                        <li>Variable speed Supply Air Fan</li>
                                        <li>2-way cooling modulating valve.</li>
                                        <li>Pre Filter.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <p>    
                                    The sequence of operation of the unit shall be as follows:<br>
                                </p>
                            <h4>Supply Air Fan Control</h4>
                                    <ol class="operation">
                                        <li>The AHU Supply air fan shall be operated by the BMS when:</li>
                                            <ul class="operated-list"> 
                                                <li class="A"> The HOA switch of the supply fan is in "Auto" position.</li>
                                                <li class="A"> The supply fan trip signal is in NORMAL state.</li>
                                                <li class="A"> The Smoke Damper Status is in OPEN position.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <li>Once the above conditions are satisfied, AHU is enabled to start in Auto mode (based on time schedule) or using a plant enable button on the graphics in manual mode by operator. Once enabled BMS will automatically command supply fan to start.</li>
                                        <li>Once the start command is issued then BMS shall monitor the differential pressure airflow switch status of the fan. If the airflow switch signal is proved "ON" then BMS will modulate fresh air damper to minimum open position (10%), enable temperature control loop to modulate the cooling coil valve and fan speed control loop.</li>
                                        <li>If the Supply fan status from the differential pressure air flow switch is not received within preset time delay of 120 seconds after the start command is being issued then an alarm will be generated and latched on the BMS and the AHU start command shall be disabled.</li>
                                        <li>The controls shall be programmed to operate the AHU for continuous 24 Hours, 7 days a week time schedule based on occupied and unoccupied mode. Only in case of fire Alarm signal (from FACP) AHU will be stopped.</li>
                                        <li>The operator can stop the AHU from the BMS anytime; however, the default state of the AHU when the DOC is reset or powered up is START.</li>
                                        <li>When the AHU is stopped or if the run status from the differential pressure air flow switch and from the MCC Panel of the AHU is not "ON" then the cooling valve & Fresh air damper will be closed i.e., 0% and will be shown on the BMS.</li>
                                        <li>To do the supply fan - stop, the manual mode check box provided in the graphics should be checked and then the Start/Stop button should be selected toÂ·STOP option. Operator should uncheck the mode checkbox to run the system in Auto mode.</li>
                                    </ol>
                            <h4>Temperature Control Loop</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The supply air temperature sensor installed in the supply air duct, will relay the measured signal (temperature) to the DDC controller, the DDC controller compares this signal with the set-point (adjustable by the operator from BMS central) and generates an analogue output to the 2-way modulating cooling valve. Based on the difference between the two values, a Proportional - Integral - Derivative program will determine the percentage of the cooling coil valves opening to achieve the desired condition. The 2-way valve is mounted on the CHW return pipe.
                                </p>
                                <p> Occupied Mode:</p>
                                <p> In occupied mode set-point value for the supply air temperature is 13.0 cc (user adjustable).</p>
                                <p> Unoccupied Mode:</p>
                                <p>In Unoccupied mode set-point value for the supply air temperature is 24.0 cc (user adjustable). DDC will modulate VFD speed and fresh air damper to minimum condition.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Dehumidification Control</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The supply air Humidity sensor installed in the supply air duct will relay the measured signal (humidity) to the DDC controller. If the supply air humidity is above its high humidity set point 70% RH (user adjustable) then BMS will modulate the cooling coil valve based on either Humidity control loop output or Temperature control loop output whichever is higher.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Fan Speed Control Loop</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Static pressure sensors located at 2/3 of the main supply air duct will sense the duct static pressure and transmit the signals to the DDC controller. DDC controller will use this sensor signal and compares this value with the set-point (adjustable by the operator from BMS central) and generates an analogue output to modulate the supply air fan speed accordingly. Based on the difference between the two values, a Proportional - Integral - Derivative program will determine the ideal fan speed to achieve the desired pressure condition. The default set point for the pressure is 100 Pa (Adjustable by the operator).
                                </p>
                            <h4>Fresh Air Damper Control</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Air Quality sensors located in the main return air duct will monitor the return air CO2 level and transmit the signals to the DDC controller. DDC controller will use this sensor signal and compares this value with the set-point (adjustable by the operator from BMS central) and generates an analogue output to modulate the Fresh air damper accordingly. Based on the difference between the two values, a Proportional - Integral - Derivative program will determine the ideal fresh air damper position to achieve the desired air quality condition. The default set point for the Air Quality is 100 ppm (Adjustable by the operator).
                                </p>
                            <h4>Fire Alarm Interlock</h4>
                                <p>Fire Alarm System control module contact will be hard wired to the emergency stop contact of MCC or local control panel of the AHU. In the event of fire detection the fire alarm system will cut off the mains power supply of the MCC or Local Control Panel that will shutdown the system (this is not part of BMS scope of work and will be provided by Fire Alarm Vendor). This control module shall be programmed in a way that activation of supply, return, or any zone alarms (as applicable} created by fire alarm system shall activate the control module to switch OFF the fan. <br>
                                   The same fire alarm signal shall be connected to BMS DDC controller, so that in case of fire alarm signal BMS will also issue a command to switch OFF the unit. Once the fire alarm signal is normalized BMS will automatically issue the command to switch ON the unit.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Alarm Reset</h4>
                                <p>
                                    When the supply air fan start command is issued by the BMS, then the BMS monitors the TRIP status of the fan & the RUN status of the fan from the differential pressure switch. In case that if any of the status goes to OFF/ALARM condition, then BMS will generate a FAN FAIL ALARM (point will be displayed on the central graphic). This alarm shall be latched until the operator resets it. The AHU start/stop command shall be disabled from the BMS until this alarm is reset.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Plant Reset</h4>
                                <p>
                                    If the unit is in "Fail" condition, then the operator can reset this alarm by using the plantreset button available on graphic screen or by putting the respective equipment H/0/A switch status in OFF or HAND mode and bringing it back to AUTO mode from local control panel {This provision is provided to facilitate the operator to reset respective equipment alarms in case graphic central communication fails with controllers). To do the Plant -reset, the manual mode check box provided in the graphics should be checked and then the RESET option should be selected. Once the RESET is activated it will come back to NORMAL state automatically after predefined delay time and mode checkbox will be unchecked automatically.
                                </p>
                            <h4>Alarms</h4>
                                <p>
                                    The following alarms would be generated on BMS.
                                </p>
                                <p class="alarms">
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Pre Filter Dirty:</span> This is generated when the pressure drop across pre filter exceeds the differential pressure switch setting and the filter is dirty.<br>
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supply Fan Trip: </span> This is generated when the supply air fan motor is tripped as sensed by panel volt free contact.<br>
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not In Auto:</span> If any of the fan and HRW HOA switch is not in 'Auto' position as sensed by panel volt free contact then this alarm will be generated.<br>
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Temperature High & Low:</span>Temperature HIGH and LOW alarms will be generated if the Supply air temperature rises above or falls below the return air temperature alarm limits.<br>
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Humidity High & Low:</span>Humidity HIGH and LOW alarms will be generated if the return air humidity rises above or falls below the alarm limits.<br><br>
                                
                                    The above alarms are active on the BMS irrespective of whether the H/0/A switch is in "Hand" or "Auto" position.<br>
                                
                                    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Supply Fan Fail:</span> In case the supply air fan fails to start or if the differential pressure switch for supply fan air flow status is not giving the signal according to the command (given from the BMS) due to any reason or the fan is giving the trip status then an alarm will be generated.<br>
                                </p>
