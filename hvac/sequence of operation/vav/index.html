                                <p>
                                    The variable air volume terminal units will maintain the flow rate required to meet the load conditions for pressure independent units. Pressure-independent variable or constant­ volume VAV boxes are essentially airflow control devices that deliver a constant volume of air Jo a conditioned space at a given temperature despite a varying supply duct static pressure. An airflow sensor in the inlet of the VAV box is used to measure the volume of air and the VAV box controller resets the airflow volume set point as the thermal load changes in the space. Therefore, a pressure independent VAV box controller provides two control sequences; zone temperature control and terminal unit air flow control. The controller has a minimum air flow set point to maintain airflow at light load conditions and a maximum airflow set point to limit the airflow to meet the design conditions for the zone.

                                    The VAV Excel 1O controllers will regulate the flow of air by modulating the VAV box damper of the relative zones in response to signals from space temperature sensors on the thermostat (wall module). <br>
                                    On demand for cooling (as per the deviation between the room temperature and room temperature set point), the Excel 10 VAV controller will modulate its damper actuator as detected by the airflow sensor and as per calculated flow in US. <br>
                                    The VAV controller will use PID algorithm to control the air volume using the feedback signal from the flow measurement grid to maintain the room temperature within ±1 Deg C. Of the . room set point. <br>
                                    When there is no cooling demand, the VAV damper will modulate to its minimum open position to maintain the minimum flow. <br>
                                    Position of the VAV damper will approximately vary from 20% to 80% open as the cooling requirement changes from minimum flow to maximum flow respectively.
